# Roles and Responsibilities:
We have decided to clone the gaana.com as look like actual website. We both take the responsibilities and work on them. We have decided that some one work on navbar, footer part and after it, we will work on pages. In the navbar lot of challenges I have faced like making sidebar, search functionality in navbar, after search open a pop up box for search content, adding language content box in navbar, toggle function for night mode of website and pop up window for login and signup. Same as in footer part also. In making pages how to make cards of songs and attached it responsively. Also making horizontal slider on each categories songs on landing page.

# Landing Page:
This is the landing page of my project. We have used import and Export function for attaching navbar to all pages in JavaScript part. And used the JavaScript code for attaching all songs card in landing page to their categories songs heading names. Also we have used forward and backward arrow for sliding the songs card on landing page.

# Challanges Faced:
We both have no idea how to clone it, we both have learnt only how to make any layout with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And also how to work with APIs. We have faced finding API, after many search we could found an API of Jio Saavn and used it in the project. We both have faced lot of works and challenges in two week like how to make it with all working functionality of the project, how to make responsive of all pages, how to attached navbar and footer in all pages. But we have finally achieved this project as original. I have faced challenges in making payer for play song and making landing page because it was complicated than other pages.
